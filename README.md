## Overview

In *Tears of the Kingdom*, Link can use the Recall rune to reverse the flow of time for a single object. When it activates, the object and the path it took are outlined in yellow and a screen wipe effect turns most of the world greyscale. In this project, I made a post processing effect that masks out objects in certain Unity layers and draws the outlines and greyscale parts of the screen to recreate the effect seen in the game.
